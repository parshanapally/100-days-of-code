# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Styled NavHeader component and imported react-calendar 

**Thoughts:** I am still working through how I would want the app to look like. I created mockup but I might change how they look. Testing this section was super easy and I was suprised because I thought it might be a challenge to mock the state.

### Day 3: June 9, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Create and Test New Project Component 

**Thoughts:** Decided to go back to the basics and relearn the es6 features. I mostly went through the arrow functions. It wasn't that difficult, but I think when I progress to object destructing, I will probably need to spend more time on that.


### Day 4: June 11, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Create a Presentation on the basic of HTML

**Thoughts:** I created a presentation on the basics of HTML for a class I will eventually teach to.
It was good to back and see how much I knew but realize that I did forget some of the acroymns and what they stand for.


### Day 5: June 13, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on the findIndex(), find(), and filter() method.

**Thoughts:** It was a struggle at first but eventually I was able to understand how the functionality works. I also made up a few new problems that I would have to solve on my own. To reiterate wrote down the steps that I needed to take and how I was able to solve the problem.

### Day 6: June 17, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on writing a post on the findIndex(), find(), and filter() method. Researched the callback function and promises. Finished slides on CSS.

**Thoughts:** I felt that I covered alot of topics today and I made alot more progress than I thought I would. I also had a break through. I finally understood how callbacks actually work. In the past I would kind of unserstand but during problems, the concept would disappear from my brain. Now I feel like I see code and be able to understand how the code works. I need to start updating this repo and start putting the progress in here, so I can look back on what I have accomplished.
