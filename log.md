# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Styled NavHeader component and imported react-calendar 

**Thoughts:** I am still working through how I would want the app to look like. I created mockup but I might change how they look. Testing this section was super easy and I was suprised because I thought it might be a challenge to mock the state.

**Today's Progress**: Create and Test New Project Component

### Day 3: June 9, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Create and Test New Project Component 

**Thoughts:** Decided to go back to the basics and relearn the es6 features. I mostly went through the arrow functions. It wasn't that difficult, but I think when I progress to object destructing, I will probably need to spend more time on that.


### Day 4: June 11, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Create a Presentation on the basic of HTML

**Thoughts:** I created a presentation on the basics of HTML for a class I will eventually teach to.
It was good to back and see how much I knew but realize that I did forget some of the acroymns and what they stand for.
