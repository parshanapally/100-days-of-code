# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Styled NavHeader component and imported react-calendar 

**Thoughts:** I am still working through how I would want the app to look like. I created mockup but I might change how they look. Testing this section was super easy and I was suprised because I thought it might be a challenge to mock the state.

### Day 2: June 8, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Create and Test New Project Component 

**Thoughts:** What I was working wasnt that difficult for me to do but I wish I could have gotten done more in this hour.
