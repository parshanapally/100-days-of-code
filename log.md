# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Styled NavHeader component and imported react-calendar 

**Thoughts:** I am still working through how I would want the app to look like. I created mockup but I might change how they look. Testing this section was super easy and I was suprised because I thought it might be a challenge to mock the state.
